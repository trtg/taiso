<h3>What is gymnastics, and why TotalTaiso?</h3>

<p>Built upon these foundational elements, TotalTaiso introduces numerous gymnastics and bodyweight-based exercises. This allows anybody, regardless of physical background, to develop the strength, balance, and flexibility needed to improve quality of life.</p>


<h3>How do I use the TotalTaiso WODs?</h3>

<p>TotalTaiso WODs (Workout of the Day) are designed to give the users a workout idea for each day of the year.  There are scaled (modified) versions of the WOD for those that are new to exercising and have not built the necessary foundation to perform complex movements.  Please keep in mind that not all exercises and movements are for everyone and that you partake in these activities at your own risk.  For more exercise ideas, please feel free to browse the many movements included in the <a href="/movements">'Movements'</a> page.  </p>

<h3>I am new to gymnastics and any form of exercising.  What do you advise?</h3>

<p>All movements are categorized into three different levels - Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced.  Use the filters included in the <a href="/movements">'Movements'</a> page to find an exercise or movement that fits your level of fitness.  You can always scale down the workouts so that you feel comfortable with your routine, and work your way up to different levels. As always, please be mindful that not all exercises and movements are for everyone.</p>

<h3>I do not have the proper equipment to perform an exercise. What should I do?</h3>

<p>TotalTaiso understands that not everyone or every gym is equipped with every type of equipment/apparatus.   There are many options at each level that require no equipment at all.
For your safety, we advise against rigging any sort of equipment for the purpose of performing any of the movements listed on TotalTaiso.</p>

<p>If you do not have access to the proper apparatus to perform an exercise, please take a look at the scaling options to see what movements are listed that you can perform without the use of any specific equipment.</p>

<h3>I am interested in learning more.  How can I get personal training and advice?</h3>

TotalTaiso offers several personal training, workshop, and seminar options to fit a variety of needs.  Check the <a href="/coaching">Coaching</a> page for more info.
